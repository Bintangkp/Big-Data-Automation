# 💡 Big-Data-Automation 💡

## About The Project
🔥 In this project, I aimed to develop an ETL automation pipeline integrated with Great Expectations (GX) for data validation. Additionally, I worked with big data tools such as PySpark for distributed data processing and NoSQL databases for flexible data storage. The project involved collecting datasets from various sources, followed by comprehensive data processing, including cleaning, handling missing values, transforming, validating, and finally storing the refined data into MongoDB. This workflow ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient management for further analysis and insights. 🚀


## Built With
In this project, we're going to working with some various tools such as:

🐍 Python → The backbone of the project

📑 Pandas → Data manipulation & analysis

⏳ Datetime → Handling timestamps and time-based data

📡 Data Exploration → Finding hidden patterns & insights

⚙️ Apache Airflow → Workflow automation & orchestration

✅ Great Expectations → Data validation & quality assurance

🗄️ MongoDB → NoSQL database for flexible data storage


## Getting Started
Before we start, make sure to follow these steps to make sure no errors while running this project

📡 Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bintangkp/Big-Data-Automation.git
```
⚙️ Make sure you have docker installed and then open and clone this repository and follow the written steps on this link
  ```sh
   https://github.com/argyadiva/airflow-with-spark
```
If you already clone the repository, make sure to put all of the ETL process into DAGS folder (within airflow)

🧐 Open your local host for airflow (from docker) and run the DAGS inside

🗄️ Dont forget to setup and adjust the load process into your own MongoDB database

📈 The automation is already successfully built
